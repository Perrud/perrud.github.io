This is a site for a Shadowrun Campaing =D
Feel free to use any of it. (I've changed a lot of the lore from South America, mostly Brazli/Amazon).

A special thanks to Sophia Ferreira, who helped me with some texts <3


PS: The theme that I used in most pages is: https://andrewhwanpark.github.io/dark-poole/
